# Project Title

This project is for Week 4 HW for Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp, which focused on implementing JQuery. 

The goal of this Crystal Collector Game is for the user to click on the crystals to exactly match the target score without going over the target score. Each crystal will have a randomly generated value. The game will record the user's wins and losses and restart the game after each win/loss, and will restart the game with a different random target score and different random crystal amounts.
